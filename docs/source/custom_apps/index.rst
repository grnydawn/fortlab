Building and running Fortlab custom apps
*******************************************

While fortran has components that collectively can extract a kernel, the actual extraction process is frequently dependent on each target application. Therefore, as an interim solution, we defer the kernel extraction to fortlab-based "applications" that are customized to the target application.

Please refer to EKEA(E3SM Kernel Extraction and Analyzer: `https://ekea.readthedocs.io <https://ekea.readthedocs.io/>`_ ) for more information on how a "fortlab application" is build.
